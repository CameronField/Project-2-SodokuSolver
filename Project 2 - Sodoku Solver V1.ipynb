    "I spent a few days playing sodoku and trying to find patterns in the way I approached solving the problem. The first thought I had was evaluating an empty cell by looking at its row and column and box one by one and seeing if I could fill in a correct answer that way. My thought was that in order to ensure that I make the computer only input correct answers only, I would have the program go to an empty cell, look at the row or column or box it was in, then see if there were 8 out of 9 that were already filled in. That way, all the program would have to do would be to fill in the remaining number. That logic would loop over and over until all the cells were filled in and the puzzle would be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to replicate that logic by hand on an empty sodoku, but realized that there are very few sodoku puzzles that had initial conditions that favored that approach. You'd have to be lucky to get a puzzle whose initial condition had a row/column/box that had 8 out of 9 already filled in, and those were the easiest of the easy sodokus. If you were not lucky, the program would just continue to infinitely loop trying to find a single solution, but never solving the puzzle. "

    "After playing some more sodokus by hand and messing around with solving techniques on a whiteboard, I found a better approach. What if for every empty sodoku cell, the program evaluated what number that cell COULD be, based on the rest of the cells in its same row/column/box? That row, column, and box would have their own list of possible values. That way, you could compare those lists of possible values to one another. If there exists a SINGLE UNIQUE number that all three share, that has to be the solution for that cell. Effectively, the program compares the intersection of sets to find a solution. The program would loop through every empty cell and repeat that logic until all cells are filled in. \n",
