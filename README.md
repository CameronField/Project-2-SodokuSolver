# Project 2 - Sodoku Solver

## Objective
There are hundreds of sodoku solvers online and most are complete solutions, but I doubt I can learn anything if I don't solve the problem myself. The plan is to start from a blank python script and work my way up to a complete solution iteratively. What I'm looking to take away from this project are some problem solving skills and a deeper understanding of both recursion and OOP. 

## Method
So far, I have not seen a single script of a sodoku solver, so I am coming in blind to the actual solution. I intend to solve the problem on my own using the following steps:

1. Play sodoku by hand to find some patterns
2. Implement those patterns in python 
3. Test initial solution script with an unsolved sodoku dataset
4. Evaluate data and present analysis
5. Repeat steps 1-5 until I get to an efficient and complete solution

Each new iteration will be posted as a new file so you can follow along with my progress and give me feedback if you see anything that I could clean up. 

Thanks for checking out my second project!
